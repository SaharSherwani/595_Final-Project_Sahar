## Focus of This Project

This project examines how the **racial and ethnic composition**—with a particular emphasis on **Black and Hispanic student populations**—in Washington, D.C. public schools (DCPS) evolved between **School Year (SY) 2012–2013 and SY 2018–2019**, and how these shifts may correlate with educational outcomes and resource changes.

Key objectives include:
- Analyzing the changes in minority (Black and Hispanic) racial and ethnic composition across the two timeframes.
- Exploring whether shifts in school demographics have an assocition with educational outcomes (i.e., school performance) or changes in the school system (i,e., closures, new openings), to understand the impact of evolving diversity.

#### Research Questions

1. **How has the racial composition of D.C. public schools changed between the 2012–2013 and 2018–2019 school years?**
2. **How do changes in racial and ethnic composition (especially Black and Hispanic populations) relate to educational outcomes or changes resource allocations?**

## Background

- **Diverse Demographics:**  
  Washington, D.C., though geographically compact, is demographically intricate—each of its **eight wards** mirrors distinct community identities and population trends. The local schools often reflect these broader neighborhood demographics.

- **Legacy of Segregation and Integration Efforts:**  
  While landmark cases like *Bolling v. Sharpe (1954)* sought to dismantle de jure segregation in D.C. schools, **de facto segregation persists**, with many schools still predominantly serving one racial or ethnic group. This legacy highlights the complexity of achieving meaningful integration in practice.

- **Benefits of Racially Diverse Schools:**  
  Social science research indicates that **greater racial and ethnic diversity within schools can enhance resource allocation, foster peer learning, and improve long-term student outcomes**. Diverse academic environments have the potential to bridge achievement gaps and promote equity across the educational landscape.

### **Datasets and Sources:**  
- **Hispanic or Latino Origin by Race (Table B03002) American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates (2012 & 2018)**  
  - **Source: U.S. Census Bureau  [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2021.B03002)*
  - The data was accessed via the Census API, and included estimates (E) and margins of error (M) for each racial category. For the purposes of this project, only DC state level census tract data was then brought in and matched to these.
  - CVs were calculated using `census_data_aggregator` to determine data reliability, and the zero or missing population values were replaced with `NaN` to avoid division errors; and for mapping, only reliable estimates (CV ≤ 40%) were used. 
  - For effective mapping, all layers (Ward, tracts etc) were reprojected to Maryland State Plane (EPSG:2248).
  - Applied **Fisher-Jenks classification** based on the 2018 distribution and used the same breaks for 2012 to ensure consistency across temporal comparisons.

## Minority Racial and Ethnic Demographic Changes in DC (2012 and 2018)
- Looking at the demographic makeup of Washington, D.C., three primary groups—**White**, **Non-Hispanic Black**, and **Hispanic**—account for nearly **95%** of the total population. Given their prominence, these three populations form the core focus of this analysis. To emphasize shifts within the two minority communities (**Non-Hispanic Black** and **Hispanic**), we specifically computed each group’s percentage share of the total population:
  
      `Non-Hispanic Black Population % = (Non-Hispanic Black Population (Estimate) / Total Population (Estimate) * 100`
            `Hispanic Population % = (Hispanic Population (Estimate) / Total Population (Estimate) * 100`
  
- These derived percentages facilitate direct comparisons across different time frames and census tracts, providing clearer insights into how these communities’ spatial distributions and relative proportions have evolved. Moreover, Fisher-Jenks classification based on the 2018 distribution were first found and same breaks were used for 2012 to ensure consistency across temporal comparisons. To show side by side comparisons, small multiples appraoch was used. 

 ### **Map 1: Non-Hispanic Black % in D.C. Census Tracts (2012 & 2018)**

![map1](map 1.png)

The maps show that, between 2012 and 2018, the **geographic distribution of the Non-Hispanic Black population has shifted in ways that highlight broader demographic transitions within D.C.** Notably, **Wards 7 and 8 experienced an increase in Non-Hispanic Black percentages**, reinforcing these areas as long-standing centers of Black community life. Conversely, **Wards 1, 4, and 5 witnessed declines**, possibly reflecting patterns of redevelopment, gentrification, and changing housing markets that have drawn more White and Hispanic residents into previously majority-Black neighborhoods.

**Although the city’s overall population may be growing more diverse, the spatial patterns suggest that certain wards remain predominantly one group, indicating that some form of racial and ethnic clustering persists.** In other words, while a city-wide perspective hints at increasing diversity, the localized view raises questions about whether this diversity is evenly distributed or concentrated in certain areas, potentially influencing access to resources and long-term educational outcomes.
